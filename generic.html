									<p>When I study abroad, I want to make friends from all over the world, not just Chinese. I'm also studying Korean, so I want to make Korean friends and talk with them, and use Chinese to talk with people from all over the world. When I am in Japan, I seldom use Chinese to talk to people, so when I hear "Talk to me! but I am too embarrassed to speak it. If I go to study abroad, I will need to speak Chinese to live comfortably, so I want to study abroad as soon as possible and see myself speaking a foreign language.</p>
									<p>I also want to eat Chinese food and go to famous places. I want to travel around China with my friends because a year seems like a long time, but it is short.</p>
									<p>After studying abroad, I now want to be in a position to support people who are going to study abroad. Before studying abroad, I think I will have the experience of being taken care of by many people. I want to remember this process and use it for my future. I would also like to have a job that supports the Chinese language. I will think about it carefully in the next three years. Thank you for reading!
